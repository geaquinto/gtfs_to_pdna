# gtfs_to_pdna
Demo for extracting network information from GTFS repositories

This example uses a random GTFS dataset that I found on the internet in May 2024.
Initially, the network refers to London, which traditionally uses the TransXChange format instead of GTFS, due to TfL's early adoption of digital timetables.
Therefore, this may not refer to real information and any assumption from the results should be taken with caution. There are many little mistakes, some that I might have overlooked; for example, main line rail services are absent.

Nevertheless, the code itself is useful. Some snippets can be extracted to calculate shortest paths or accessibility measures. I will gradually add more details here.
